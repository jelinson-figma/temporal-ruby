    # In local mode, Temporal.start_workflow normally runs the workflow inline and
    # synchronously, which collapses the start/run distinction that exists against a
    # real Temporal server (start_workflow enqueues; the workflow runs later, out of
    # process). That inline execution is wrong for a caller that holds a resource --
    # e.g. a lock -- across the start_workflow call and expects the workflow to run
    # only after it has returned and released that resource.
    #
    # Inside a Temporal::Testing.with_deferred_starts block, start_workflow instead
    # defers execution: the workflow is queued and run when the block exits, after the
    # caller's stack has unwound. This lets a test model the real async ordering.
    #
    # Awaited workflows cannot be deferred: await_workflow_result needs the result
    # synchronously, and local mode does not capture a workflow's return value. Only
    # fire-and-forget start_workflow calls should run inside the block.
